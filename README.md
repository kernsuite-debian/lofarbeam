# LOFAR beam library

Stand alone version of the LOFAR station response library.

This package has undergone the same branching process as [the DP3 package](https://github.com/lofar-astron/DP3): it is a continuation of the LOFAR beam library at svn.astron.nl/LOFAR, and was extracted from and branched off LOFAR Release 3.2. The LOFAR beam package will likely not be maintained in the ASTRON repository.
