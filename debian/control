Description: Stand-alone version of the LOFAR station response library
 This package has undergone the same branching process as the DP3 package: it
 is a continuation of the LOFAR beam library at svn.astron.nl/LOFAR, and was
 extracted from and branched off LOFAR Release 3.2. The LOFAR beam package
 will likely not be maintained in the ASTRON repository.
